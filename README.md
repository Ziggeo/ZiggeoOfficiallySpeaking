Officially Speaking
=================

Ziggeo API (http://ziggeo.com) allows you to integrate video recording and playback with only
two lines of code in your site, service or app. 

Government officials and agencies are often perceived as impersonal and inaccessible. Likewise, officials often feel removed from the very citizens they're serving. Officially Speaking is an attempt to break down those barriers and make government interactions more personal.  
Through the use of Ziggeo's API for asynchronous video recording and playback, Officially Speaking is a video Q & A system that lets citizens record questions on video from any mobile (or other) device that are submitted directly to officials who can likewise easily respond on video.  And through a system of up-voting, officials can respond to those questions most of interest to citizens.  
By letting citizens and officials see each other for who they are, we're hoping to put the heart and soul back into government interactions.


Setup
======

Copy config.default.js to config.js and replace all missing API keys with the correct ones. We
recommend running the application with Heroku, but really any NodeJS environment should do the
tricks.
